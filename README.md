# Music Platform Project

## Overview
This project is a music streaming platform with features such as music streaming, searching, categorization, user authentication, and personalized recommendations.

---

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React, Tailwind CSS.  
- **Backend**: Node.js (TypeScript).  
- **Database**: MongoDB.  
- **State Management**: TanStack React Query for server-side state management and caching.  
- **Testing**: Jest for unit testing.  
- **Linting**: ESLint (Airbnb rules).  
- **Storybook**: For UI component documentation and testing.  
- **Git Hooks**: Husky for enforcing pre-commit and pre-push checks.

## Development Principles
1. **Atomic Design**:  
   - Break down UI into five hierarchical levels: atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, and pages.  
   - Use Storybook to create and manage reusable components.  

2. **SOLID Principles**:  
   - Write maintainable, extendable, and scalable code by adhering to SOLID principles.  

3. **Testing Best Practices**:  
   - Use Jest for unit testing.  
   - Example test file structure:  
     ```
     /src/components/
       ├── Button/
       │   ├── Button.tsx
       │   ├── Button.test.tsx
       │   └── Button.stories.tsx
     ```
   - Example Jest test for a button:  
     ```typescript
     import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
     import Button from './Button';

     test('renders button with correct label', () => {
       render(<Button label="Click Me" />);
       const buttonElement = screen.getByText(/click me/i);
       expect(buttonElement).toBeInTheDocument();
     });
     ```

## Git Practices
1. **Branching**:  
   - Create a new branch for each feature or fix:  
     - `feature/[feature-name]` for new features.  
     - `bugfix/[issue-description]` for bug fixes.  

2. **Commit Messages**:  
   - Use a clear and consistent format:  
     - `[type]: [description]`  
       - Example: `feat: add user authentication feature`.  

3. **Pull Requests**:  
   - Always create a pull request for review before merging to `master`.  
   - Ensure all comments are addressed before final approval.  

4. **No Direct Updates to GitHub**:  
   - Do not push directly to the `master` branch.  

5. **Pre-Commit and Pre-Push Checks**:  
   - Husky hooks enforce linting, testing, and other checks before committing or pushing code.  

6. **Conflict Resolution**:  
   - Always resolve merge conflicts locally before pushing changes.

## Workflow
1. **Cloning the Repository**:  
   ```bash
   git clone [repo-url]
   cd [project-folder]
   ```

2. **Environment Setup**:  
   - Add a `.env` file with necessary environment variables (e.g., API keys, database URLs).  

3. **Install Dependencies**:  
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start the Development Server**:  
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. **Create a New Branch**:  
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/[feature-name]
   ```

6. **Run Linting and Tests**:  
   - Linting:  
     ```bash
     npm run lint
     ```
   - Testing:  
     ```bash
     npm test
     ```

7. **Push Changes**:  
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/[feature-name]
   ```

8. **Create a Pull Request**:  
   - Open a PR on GitHub and request a peer review.

## Tools and Packages Used
1. **TanStack React Query**: For efficient server-side state management.  
2. **Storybook**: For building, documenting, and testing UI components.  
3. **Jest**: For unit and integration testing.  
4. **Husky**: To enforce pre-commit and pre-push checks.  
5. **ESLint (Airbnb)**: To maintain consistent coding standards.

## Contribution Guidelines
1. Follow the branching and commit message conventions.  
2. Ensure all code passes linting and tests before submitting a pull request.  
3. Use Storybook to document any new components.  
4. Address all comments during PR reviews before merging.
